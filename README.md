## Dev Onboarding

### Local System Setup

#### Mac Users

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh>)"
```

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Start the Docker Desktop Application before proceeding further.

- Add your machineâ€™s [SSH keys on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

- Create a new folder and paste mac_deployer.sh (refer Attachments) in that folder.

- Run the script using the command below. (You'll need to define credentials for various services and configurations of resources required by TestAtScale system)

```bash
bash mac_deployer.sh
```

**This script may ask for your root password in order to add entry in /etc/hosts.**

#### For Windows Users:

For window users you have to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) first.
- Run the command prompt as an administator.

```bash
wsl --install
```
- Next you need to restart system upon which the ubuntu terminal will automatically appear.
- Create a username and set the password.

- Next, you need to update the system by running the following command:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

- You have to install recent version of GCC and glibc.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install gcc gilbc
```

- Next you need to add Git

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
```

- Install docker from the [website download](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/)

- Now install Homebrew

``` bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Then next you need to set the PATH for Homebrew by running the following commands:

```bash
$ echo '# Set PATH, MANPATH, etc., for Homebrew.' >> /home/zuh/.profile
$ echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/zuh/.profile
$ eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

- Now install gcc by brew

```bash
$ brew install gcc
```
- After installing gcc, clone the github repository "LambdaTest/test-at-scale-scripts" using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/test-at-scale-scripts.git
```

- Now check and go to newly generated directory name "test-at-scale-scripts"

```bash
$ cd test-at-scale-scripts/mac_setup
```

- Finally you need to run the script:
``` bash
$ bash mac_deployer.sh 
```
